## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Decisions

### Project Structure
- *Next.js App Router*: Uses the /app directory for routing, layouts, and server/client components, enabling modular, scalable code.
- *Redux Toolkit*: Manages global state for cart and authentication, with localStorage persistence for both.
- *TypeScript*: Ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors.
- *Tailwind CSS*: Provides a utility-first, responsive, and consistent design system.
- *Component-based*: Layout, header, and footer are shared across pages for consistency.

### Mock Data & Persistence
- *Mock Authentication*: Sign up and login are handled entirely in the browser using localStorage. User data is stored and checked locally, with Redux state reflecting the current session.
- *Cart Persistence*: Cart state is saved to localStorage and restored on page reload, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.
- *No Backend Required*: All data (products, users, cart) is managed in the browser, making the app easy to demo, test, and extend.

### UI/UX Features
- *Modern, Responsive Design*: Inspired by leading e-commerce platforms, with a split-screen layout for auth pages and a clean, mobile-friendly product catalogue.
- *Pagination*: Product lists are paginated for better usability, even with large mock datasets.
- *Out-of-Stock Handling*: Products with zero stock are clearly labelled and cannot be added to the cart.
- *Navigation*: After login/signup, users are redirected to the homepage. Logout is available in the header when logged in and redirects to the login page.
- *Form Validation*: All forms use Zod schemas for robust, type-safe validation.

### Trade-offs & Rationale
- *Frontend-Only*: No backend/API is required, making the app easy to run anywhere and ideal for prototyping or UI/UX testing.
- *LocalStorage for Auth/Cart*: Chosen for simplicity and demo purposes; not secure for production, but perfect for mock/demo apps.
- *Redux vs. Context*: Redux is used for its devtools, scalability, and ease of state persistence, even though Context could suffice for smaller apps.
- *No Real Security*: All authentication is mock and for demonstration only.
