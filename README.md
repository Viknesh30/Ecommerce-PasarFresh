# PasarFresh ü•¨

*PasarFresh* is a modern e-commerce web application for a local wet market. It features a beautiful UI, product search, filtering, a shopping cart experience, and mock authentication‚Äîall running fully in the browser with localStorage.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Decisions

### Project Structure

- *Next.js App Router*: Uses the /app directory for routing, layouts, and server/client components, enabling modular, scalable code.
- *Redux Toolkit*: Manages global state for cart and authentication, with localStorage persistence for both.
- *TypeScript*: Ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors.
- *Tailwind CSS*: Provides a utility-first, responsive, and consistent design system.
- *Component-based*: Layout, header, and footer are shared across pages for consistency.

### Mock Data & Persistence

- *Mock Authentication*: Sign up and login are handled entirely in the browser using localStorage. User data is stored and checked locally, with Redux state reflecting the current session.
- All data (products, users, cart) is managed in the browser, making the app easy to demo, test, and extend.

### UI/UX Features

- *Modern, Responsive Design*: Inspired by leading e-commerce platforms, with a split-screen layout for auth pages and a clean, mobile-friendly product catalogue.
- *Pagination*: Product lists are paginated for better usability, even with large mock datasets.
- *Navigation*: After login/signup, users are redirected to the homepage. Logout is available in the header when logged in and redirects to the login page.

### Trade-offs & Rationale

- *Frontend-Only*: No backend/API is required, making the app easy to run anywhere and ideal for prototyping or UI/UX testing.
- *LocalStorage for Auth/Cart*: Chosen for simplicity and demo purposes; not secure for production, but perfect for mock/demo apps.
