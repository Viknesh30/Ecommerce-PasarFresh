# PasarFresh ü•¨

*PasarFresh* is a modern e-commerce web application for a local wet market. It features a beautiful UI, product search, filtering, and a shopping cart experience.


# üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Decisions

## Project Structure

- *Next.js App Router*: Uses the new /app directory for routing, layouts, and server/client components, enabling better code organization and performance.
- *Modular Folders*: Code is organized by feature (e.g., products, auth, components/layout, store), making it scalable and maintainable.
- *TypeScript*: Ensures type safety across the codebase, reducing runtime errors and improving developer experience.

## State Management

- *Redux Toolkit*: Chosen for global state (auth, cart) due to its scalability, devtools support, and ease of integration with React.
  - Trade-off: Slightly more boilerplate than Context API, but much better for complex state and debugging.

## Styling

- *Tailwind CSS*: Enables rapid UI development with utility classes, ensuring a consistent, responsive design.

## Forms & Validation

- *React Hook Form + Zod*: Provides performant, scalable form handling with schema-based validation.

## API Layer

- *Axios*: Used for HTTP requests, wrapped in a custom API layer (src/lib/api.ts) for easier future backend integration and error handling.
  - Trade-off: Could use fetch for smaller bundles, but Axios offers better features and interceptors.

## UI/UX Decisions

- *Modern, Responsive Design*: Inspired by leading e-commerce platforms (e.g., Shopee), with a split-screen layout for auth pages, prominent branding, and mobile-first responsiveness.
- *Component Reuse*: Layout, header, and footer components are shared across pages for consistency.
- *Sample Data*: Product and category data are mocked for now, making it easy to swap in a real API later.

## Trade-offs & Future Improvements

- *No Backend Integration Yet*: The app is API-ready but uses sample/mock data for now. This allows rapid UI prototyping and easy backend swapping later.
- *Authentication*: UI is ready, but real authentication requires backend integration.
- *Cart/Checkout*: Cart state is managed in Redux, but checkout logic is stubbed for future backend work.
- *Testing*: No automated tests yet; recommend adding unit and integration tests as the app grows.

## Why These Choices?

- *Next.js App Router*: Modern, flexible, and future-proof for React apps.
- *Redux Toolkit*: Best for apps that may grow in complexity.
- *Tailwind CSS*: Fast, consistent, and easy to maintain.
- *TypeScript*: Reduces bugs and improves code quality.
- *React Hook Form + Zod*: Scalable, type-safe forms.

This architecture balances rapid development, scalability, and maintainability, making it easy to extend PasarFresh as your needs grow.
